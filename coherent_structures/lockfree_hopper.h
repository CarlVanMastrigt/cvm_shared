/** lockfree_hopper
 * a hopper is a simplified stack that supports atomic addition, but then must be locked before its entries are accessed
 * locking prevents addition (attempting to add will return false) and must be reset before it can be used again
 * locking also gets the first entry, subsequent entries must then be acquired using one of the iterate function
 * entries should be relinquished back to the hoppers backing pool after the next entry has been acquired
 * iterate will return null when the hopper has been exhausted, the range iterated should then be relinquished*/
