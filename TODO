-Actually use cvm_lists data structures everywhere applicable, especially binary heap.
-Rename matrix*f to mat*f
-Provide to convert float structures matrix4f,vec3f &c to GLfloat arrays
-Review all widget function names and update code style for widgets (also needs cleaning)
-Change widget text to use UTF-8 format rather than ascii
-update file_search widget to be able to run on windows
-managed buffer needs cleanup and renaming (maybe instance_buffer) also review size_delta in it and look at how it's actually used and whether some of its functions are really needed
-load_shader needs to better recognise include & report errors (find deliniating "s)
-remove mesh groups as specified, create static mesh_group objects as needed and with features as necessary (adjacent &c.)
-condider using uint32_t in meshes for indexes (allows more than 65k vertex meshes)
-add uv/norm support to meshes
-allow meshed to have uv/normals set as well as adjacency information, (if different data is required depending on provoking triangle, need dupltcated verts with the variant data (uv/norm) and mesh indices to use these alternate data but still use correct vertexes for adjacents (if adjacents present))
-scrollbar reset function (sets offset to minimum (top of list)
