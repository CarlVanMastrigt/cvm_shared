-Actually use cvm_lists data structures everywhere applicable, especially binary heap.
-Rename matrix*f to mat*f
-Provide to convert float structures matrix4f,vec3f &c to GLfloat arrays
-Review all widget function names and update code style for widgets (also needs cleaning)
-Change widget text to use UTF-8 format rather than ascii
-update file_search widget to be able to run on windows
-managed buffer needs cleanup and renaming (maybe instance_buffer) also review size_delta in it and look at how it's actually used and whether some of its functions are really needed
-load_shader needs to better recognise include & report errors (find deliniating "s)
